# Flymation: Interactive Animation for Flying Robots

Trajectory visualization and animation play critical roles in robotics research. However, existing data visualization and animation tools often lack flexibility, scalability, and versatility, resulting in limited capability to fully explore and analyze flight data. To address this limitation, we introduce **Flymation**, a new flight trajectory visualization and animation tool. Built on the Unity3D engine, **Flymation** is an intuitive and interactive tool that allows users to visualize and analyze flight data in real time. Users can import data from various sources, including flight simulators and real-world data, and create customized visualizations with high-quality rendering. With **Flymation**, users can choose between trajectory snapshot and animation; both provide valuable insights into the behavior of the underlying autonomous system. **Flymation** represents an exciting step toward visualizing and interacting with large-scale data in robotics research.
