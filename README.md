# Drone Animation 

Quadrotors are among the most popular robotic platform in research. Many people spend a lot of time on visualizing the drone trajectory. State-of-the-art tools include Matlab, Python, ROS, and Blender. In this work, we present an open-source project called FlightmareAnimation for trajectory visualization and animation. Download the Unity standalone and use it directly without installing additional pacakges.
